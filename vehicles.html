								<p>Polaris is an open-framed AUV, designed with a low vehicle aspect ratio to facilitate station-keeping. 
									Polaris is equipped with 8 thrusters for 6 DOF control and has a large self-righting moment, 
									achieved through the positioning of a 960 cubic inch, watertight electronics housing at the top of the AUV. 
									Polaris’ subsystems are mounted to a plastic plate, produced using 2-axis manufacturing techniques. 
									The ease of manufacturing of this plate makes Polaris a modular framework, as subsystems can be added 
									and removed without significant modifications to the vehicle.
								</p>

								<h4>Key Stats</h4>
								<p>Dry Weight: 90 lbs<br>
									Overall Dimensions (excluding thrusters): 35 in L x 16.5 in W x 21.5 in H<br>
									Depth Rating: 300 ft (torpedo actuator)
								</p>

								<h4>Mechanical Highlights</h4>
									<h5>Accessible Main Electronics Housing: </h5>
										<p>To gain access to the main computer the two supporting clamps can be pivoted up and the main housing tube can be removed, 
											revealing the internal electronics.
										</p>
								
									<h5>Torpedoes: </h5>
										<p>Polaris is equipped with two 3D printed torpedoes. These torpedoes are propelled using compressed air 
											stored inside a PVC cylinder and are actuated using a solenoid-controlled one-way valve

								<h4>Electrical Highlights</h4>
									<h5>Motor Controller: </h5>
										<p>The motor controller was revised for 2018. In 2017, each motor controller could control up to 
											three motors on one PCB. In order to control all six motors on Nautilus’, two motor controllers were needed.  
											Early in the design process, AUVIC determined that Polaris was going to have eight motors to simplify 
											the control algorithm. AUVIC also wanted to integrate all the electronic speed controllers (ESCs) into one housing. 
											The motor controller was upgraded in order to control eight motors simultaneously, while also using the PCB as a bus-bar. 
											Connectors on the motor control board were made reversible, to prevent damage to the motors if the 
											connector were connected in reverse. The system was upgraded from a F0 micro to a F4, 
											which has a floating point unit for PID controls and may be implemented in the future.

									<h5>Power Board: </h5>
										<p>The Power Regulation Board is a new PCB that is entering its manufacturing stage. The PCB will be the 
											central power hub for all components on the submarine. The board selects either the batteries or a tethered 
											power source to power the sub, and is capable of cutting power via an on-board micro-controller to various 
											systems in the submarine. RoboSub Rules requires that the sub have a “kill switch”, with can be pulled by 
											divers to cut power to the submarine. This is implemented by using a magnetic switch, which cuts power to 
											the sub when the switch is pulled. The Power Regulation Board must also be able to handle enough current 
											to power the eight motors. This board also acts as a monitor for the main housing of the submarine by 
											monitoring the housings pressure, temperature and humidity. It comes with an on-board water sensor, 
											and it has the capabilities to measure the external water pressure. It measures the current being 
											drawn from both the batteries and by individual subsystems, and has the ability to connect and disconnect 
											the batteries in parallel using control logic from the micro-controller. The board is fused to protect against 
											short-circuits in any of the subsystems.
										</p>
										<div class="row uniform 50%">
											<img src="images/power_board.png" class="image fit" alt="" />
										</div>
										<p>The board has a USB connector that can be used for USART communications. 
											The micro-controller also has the capabilities to be powered either through USB or by the batteries, 
											which is useful for debugging purposes, when batteries aren't available. The relays are used to 
											switch between battery power and tether power, and will always chose tether power over battery power 
											when the tether is available. This can be used to easily conserve battery life during testing.
										</p>
									
									<h5>Hydrophone Board: </h5>
										<p>Sonar systems are an integral part of the submarine’s design. To complete many of the objectives 
											in the competitions, the submarine must be able to locate pingers, or underwater speakers, 
											emitting sound at fixed frequencies. The solve this problem, our submarine has an array of 
											four hydrophones (underwater microphones). These hydrophones are all separated by a fixed/known 
											distance. By analyzing the phase difference of the incoming waves to the array of hydrophones, 
											we can triangulate the location of the pinger. To accomplish this, the hydrophone boards process 
											and convert the incoming data.The hydrophone boards consist of two sub-boards: the micro-controller
											board and the pre-amplification board. The pre-amplification board is placed at the same location 
											as the hydrophones, in a small housing at the bottom of the submarine. The board amplifies all incoming 
											signals from the hydrophones, and transmits them off to the main housing. In the main housing, the 
											micro-controller board converts the analog signals to digital, and sends the digital data to the main 
											computer.

								<h4>Side Projects</h4>
									<h5>Underwater Acoustic Pinger: </h5>
										<p>The competition, RoboSub, utilizes a Pinger supplied by one of their sponsors each year. Unfortunatly we lack 
											sufficient funds to acquire such a device, we have come up with an affordable solution. Using what we know 
											about the device through the competition manual, we designed a pinger to meet competition standards for a 
											fraction of the cost.
										</p>
									<h5>Ni-Cd Battery Charger: </h5>
										<p>The battery charger wsa built to supply 60 mA to the pinger's battery. The reason we chose 60 mA was to utilize 
											Nickel Cadmium's special property that prevents overcharge by dissapaiting extra charge as heat when supplied 
											with a constant current of 1/10 its max current.
